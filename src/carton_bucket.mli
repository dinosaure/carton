(** A bucket is a simple option array to contain something. When the
    bucket is full and you try to add a new value, we erase the oldest
    one. *)

type 'a t
(** The type of the bucket. *)

val make: int -> 'a t
(** Make a new bucket with a specified size. *)

val add: 'a t -> 'a -> unit
(** [add t v] adds the new value [v] in the bucket [t]. If the bucket
    is full, we erase by [v] the oldest value of [t]. *)

val iter: 'a t -> ('a -> unit) -> unit
(** [iter t f] applies [f] to all values in the bucket [ลง]. [f]
    receives each value. *)

val find: 'a t -> ('a -> bool) -> 'a option
(** [find t f] returns the first value which respects the predicate
    [f]. Otherwise, it returns [None]. *)
